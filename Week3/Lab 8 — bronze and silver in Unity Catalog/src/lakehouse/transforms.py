"""The lakehouse transforms, in PySpark, runnable locally.

The notebooks in databricks/ are the deliverable — they use Delta and Unity
Catalog and run on a workspace. This module holds the same LOGIC in plain
PySpark so it can be executed and tested on a laptop, which matters for the
three things that are genuinely easy to get wrong:

  1. Deduplication that survives a tie
  2. The SCD Type 2 merge when a key changes TWICE IN ONE BATCH
  3. Late-arriving data landing in a partition that already exists

Delta's MERGE will throw on case 2 rather than silently doing the wrong thing,
which is a good design — but only if you know why it throws. The dedup-before-
merge here is what the notebook does, and this is where it is proved.
